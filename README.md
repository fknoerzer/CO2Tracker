# Capstone: Holiday Footprint App

This is my capstone Project of the Java bootcamp of neuefische which I attended from march to june 2022.

Holiday Footprint gives travelers the opportunity to calculate and analyze the carbon footprint of their trips. Users are able to add, edit, update, delete, and analyze emissions from transportation, accommodation, diet, shopping, and activities during their trips. Furthermore, Holiday Footprint shows options to compensate your carbon footprint.
